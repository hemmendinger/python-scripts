## Scripts
Some scripts for practice and practical purposes.
(Some of these can be accomplished with simple shell scripts and one-liners, obviously. But that wouldn't be any fun.)

### activate_window.py
Use this script to bring a window to the forefront.

Example: emacs gets buried in a pile of windows, assign a shortcut that activates any visible instances of it.

### replace-filename-spaces.py

### file_existence_monitor.py
